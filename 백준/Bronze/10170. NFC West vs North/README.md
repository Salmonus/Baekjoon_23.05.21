### 문제 설명

<p>Your friends from the Midwest are always reminding you that the Seattle Seahawks won the NFC West Division with a losing record of 7-9 in 2011. At the time they were the only team to go to the NFL playoffs with a losing record (in a full season). To put an end to this nonsense you have decided to write a program to print the current NFC West and NFC North division standings.</p>

### 입력
